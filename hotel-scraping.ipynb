Lots of light fixtures, so that one can have as little or as much light as one needs. Kid's bed is in a cozy little somewhat isolated area, far from your bed, so that you can stay up and read, and the kid can sleep. Bathrooms are nice. On the second floor of the hotel, there is a nice library/dining room, where breakfast is served, and also a nice place to hang out if you have a friend to visit. Walk to lots of restaurant. Short walk to Subway, just a few minutes ride anywhere uptown or downtown. There is a Cape Cod feeling in the middle of NYC :) Thank you!\"],\n",

Unfortunately, the positives stop there. Upon arrival, we were not greeted or made to feel welcome. The man on reception was very rude - we soon found this was a theme with all members of staff. When we got to our room we were shocked at what we saw. The room was dated, filthy and smelt. When we booked the hotel the rooms looked lovely online but what the reality was couldn’t be further from the truth. Dirt all up the walls, stains on the floor and do not get me started on the bedding. We barely slept because it was so itchy and the walls are so thin you can’t get any sleep because you can hear the people in the next door snoring and doing god knows what else. All I can say is whoever the cleaners are - they are not doing a very good job. I am British so pride myself on not complaining - but I felt pushed off the edge by the rudeness of the staff. One last thing - the WiFi barely works. The location is great - thank god in New York you don’t spend much time in your hotel. Would not recommend. ',\n",
